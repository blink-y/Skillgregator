Milestone 3: Task B and Task D

Since our code has PHP embedded into the HTML for Datbase Operations, we are unable to seperate Task B and Task D.
In order to run our database, we used XAMPP 8.0.28-0 to run a local Apache Web Server and MySQL DataBase.
We used Port 80 for the Apache Web Server and Port 3306 for the MySQL Database.

In order to run the website, please install php and then run 'php -S localhost:8000'
Load.sql and create.sql can be loaded into the MySQL Database from phpMyAdmin at http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
